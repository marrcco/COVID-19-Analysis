# COVID-19-Analysis
Since the first reports of cases from Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China, at the end of 2019, more than 80,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in China; these include all laboratory-confirmed cases as well as clinically diagnosed cases in the Hubei Province. A joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission estimated that the epidemic in China peaked between late January and early February 2020. The majority of reports have been from Hubei and surrounding provinces, but numerous cases have been reported in other provinces and municipalities throughout China.   To get to know this virus better, I think it's important that we all invest the effort and resources we have. I'm glad to see so many Data Scientists here sharing their visualizations and analysis.
